I need an image for an open source project.  The project is https://github.com/johncclayton/pulumi-yoyo and makes using hierarchies of pulumi stacks a lot easier to manage as a group.  I want a modern, elegant application icon for use in GitHub and on the website.  The icon should be colourful, simple and reflect the idea of a yoyo on a group of pulumi stacks, can you make sure it has this size: 1280×640px, and don't use the pulumi logo or its trade marked images.  Yoyo string and movement.
